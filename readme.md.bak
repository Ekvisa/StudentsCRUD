#Students API (Express + TypeScript)
A small REST API for managing a student list. 
Supports CRUD operations (create, read, edit, delete) and is used by a frontend with a table and modal window. 
The project was created for educational practice with: 
- Express
- TypeScript
- file-based "database" (db.json)

##🗂 How the "database" works
All data is stored in the file:
    src/db.json
Every POST, PUT, and DELETE:
- reads the file
- modifies the array
- overwrites db.json
